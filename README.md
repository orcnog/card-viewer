# card-viewer
#### A Module for Foundry VTT

## Purpose
I found there was no out-of-the-box way to simply view a card.  Taking inspiration from a popular 5e toolset, I ported their card viewer over to the Foundry system.  Now, I can view cards beautifully in a 3d-feel viewer, flip the cards over to view the card art or read the card stats, and even share this beautiful view with my players on the fly.

## Dependencies
None

## Compatibility
This was built on Foundry v11, but would likely be compatible with v10 or maybe even lower.  As for compatibility with other modules, none have been tested, but the functionality of this mod doesn't mess with the core card system and only serves to enhance the UI in exactly one way, so I doubt there will be many conflicts.
